# Multi-T
This is an official implementation of our ECCV-24 paper: “Rethinking Unsupervised Outlier Detection via Multiple Thresholding”。

## Step 1: preparing the data (image feature): the image feature can be downloaded from
ResNet: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UsDMbE3cbA4FgcD4lDiaL2fDxiuwcmHA?usp=drive_link \
CLIP: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XjchpD1gEnTeVDSOhYkAkNUxz6CI0l-G?usp=sharing
and then put into the main path.

## Step 2: generate multiple thresholds: one for isolate inliers and another for split outliers.

## Step 3: adopting Multi-T to existing methods.

We provide the visualization.ipynb file for understanding and using our algorithm.
